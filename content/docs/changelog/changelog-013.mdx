Hey everyone! This week we pushed a handful of improvements and fixes across Steel Cloud and Steel Browser. Nothing too crazy, but some solid quality of life updates.

### ⭐ New

#### _OpenTelemetry Support 🔧_

Steel-browser now has OpenTelemetry support. You can hook logs and events to your own providers. Metrics are automatically configured. Connect your favorite providers like Sentry or Axiom and get trace visibility easier than ever.

### 🔧 Bugfixes/Improvements

*   Added a feedback button to the dashboard so you can share feedback easier and quicker
*   Stealth improvements on the canvas fingerprinting side and other browser leaks related to workers
*   Some session player improvements - fixed issue with long sessions causing pages to crash (more improvements on the way)
*   Steel Browser: fix platform details not persisting when generated for the browser,
*   A couple other small UI and API fixes

As always, thanks for testing out Steel’s Beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.
