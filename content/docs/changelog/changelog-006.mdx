Happy April Fools day y’all! We’ve been heads down this week on some large features that we have coming soon — but thought we should give you guys a little update

### 🔧 Bugfixes/Improvements

*   Bug causing the session viewer to flicker on certain websites is no longer
*   Issue with non-existent session directory when starting up steel-browser is now gone
*   "proxyTxBytes is required!" error when accessing past session details was also fixed
*   On steel-browser, you can now pass in `SKIP_FINGERPRINT_INJECTION` to override our stealth logic and use your own

### 🏡 Housekeeping

*   HUUUGE welcome to the newest members of the Steel team [Dane](https://x.com/daneo_w) and [JunHyoung](https://github.com/junhsss)! They’ll both be pushing tons of features to steel-browser and Steel Cloud and join us in building out the rest of the Steel universe!

### 💖 First-time contributors

Special thanks to the following new contributors who've made the above improvements possible 💖 [@jagadeshjai](https://github.com/jagadeshjai)
