We decided to maniacally focus on the Steel UX this week and we’re crazy pumped to show you what’s new. Let’s get it 🫡

### ⭐ New

**New Steel Dashboard Experience ✨**

The Steel dashboard has a sleek new look and feel! We’ve redesigned what it feels like to use Steel Cloud and get onboarded for the first time. We focused on quickly getting started for new users and starting new projects for experienced users.

We’re super proud of this one and look forward to your feedback.

Quick run through of new Steel Quickstart Experience

*Coming to the steel-browser repo experience soon!*

#### Docs & cookbook updates👨‍🍳

You asked and we listened: A bunch of new resources have been created across the Steel Universe.

* **Browser-use:** We’ve added a cookbook example and quickstart guide to using browser-use with Steel. Browser-use x Steel is an insanely powerful combo we’ve seen many users deploy and wanted to help make it even easier to get started.
    * [Cookbook Example](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook/tree/main/examples/steel-browser-use-starter) | [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/integrations/browser-use/quickstart)
* **DebugURL use-cases:** We’ve added new guides to our docs with a focus on how to best leverage the powerful little debug URL you get back from a Steel session response. Check em out:
    * [Embed and view live sessions](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/view-and-embed-live-sessions) | [Human in the Loop Controls](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/implement-human-in-the-loop-controls)

**Surf model updates**

We’ve upgraded [surf.new](http://surf.new/) with a bunch of new models that you can try out like:

* **Deepseek** (`deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner`)
* **Gemini** (like `2.0 flash` _fast!_)
* **Claude 3.7 sonnet** (woah + _fast!_)

Or use local models running on your computer with Ollama support :)

### 🔧 Bugfixes/Improvements

* Patched issues with fetching and re-using contexts between Sessions (docs coming soon)
* DebugURL went through a variety of changes + has had it’s full capabilities rolled out to the steel-browser repo
* Added event counts to Steel Cloud’s Sessions page to make it easier to sift through sessions lists
* _Steel-browser:_ Improved logging across the board + other upgrades (checkout the latest release here: : [**v0.1.3-beta**](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser/releases/tag/v0.1.3-beta))
* Improved session viewer reliability across the board when viewing live sessions (even more coming!)

### 🏡 Housekeeping

* This week, we welcomed [Mislav](https://x.com/mislavjc) to the Steel team! He’ll be working on making building agents on Steel even easier and more capable. You can bug him in the Steel discord server @mislavjc.

### 💖 First-time contributors

Special thanks [**@hakzarov**](https://github.com/hakzarov) for adding better logging for both the API and the Chrome process on the steel-browser repo!

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.
