This week brought some open-source improvements and enhanced developer experience across Steel's ecosystem. We focused on improving onboarding, docs, and fixing critical session management issues.

### ⭐ New

#### Steel CAPTCHAs API

Launched a complete CAPTCHAs API with real-time visibility and control over CAPTCHA detection, solving progress, and completion status. The API provides two powerful capabilities: status monitoring for tracking all CAPTCHAs across pages in real-time, and direct solving of image CAPTCHAs using XPath selectors for precise control over the solving process. No more waiting blindly or checking the DOM repeatedly - you get instant visibility into what CAPTCHAs are active, which are being solved, and exactly how long each task is taking.

```js
# Solving an image captcha, common on legacy sites like govt portals
const response = await client.sessions.captchas.solveImage('sessionId', {
  imageXPath: '//img[@id="captcha-image"]',
  inputXPath: '//input[@name="captcha"]',
});
```

**_Available on:_** Steel Cloud ☁️
