This week brought a ton of DevEx upgrades: the Steel CLI, OpenAI Computer-use integration, and a major Steel Browser release with centralized code templates across our entire ecosystem.

### ⭐ New

#### Steel CLI

<Image src="/images/Untitled.png" alt="Steel CLI" width={800} height={500} />

The fastest way to execute browser agents from the command line just dropped. Run any agent from our cookbook with zero setup - no environment files, no forking, no version management required.

```bash Terminal -wc
# Execute any task with a single command
steel run browser-use -t "find the latest Python releases" -o

# Build from ready-to-use templates
steel forge browser-use
steel forge oai-cua
steel forge playwright

# Authenticate once, run everywhere
steel login
```


The CLI handles Steel authentication automatically and works with every agent in our cookbook. You can even skip installation entirely by using `npx @steel-dev/cli` for any command.

#### OpenAI Computer-Use Integration

OpenAI's Computer-use agents can now run directly on Steel infrastructure with ready-to-use starter kits. TypeScript and Python implementations are available across the Cookbook, Steel Playground, and CLI.

```bash Terminal -wc
# Get started with OAI CUA on Steel in minutes
steel forge oai-cua

```

#### Steel Browser 0.2.0-beta Release

Steel Browser has been upgraded from 0.1.3-beta to 0.2.0-beta with significant architecture improvements, ARM64 Docker support, and enhanced fingerprinting solutions.

[**Release Notes**](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta)

#### Centralized Code Registry

All code templates and examples are now centralized into a unified registry system. This ensures consistent, up-to-date code across the Cookbook, onboarding flows, documentation, playground, and CLI - no more version drift between different code examples.

### 🔧 Improvements

*   Added ARM64 architecture support in Docker builds while removing problematic UI build changes in steel-browser

*   Added automatic release generation for pull requests in steel-browser repo

*   Updated browser-use version and code to newest version across all assets

*   Standardized styling across all example components for consistent visual presentation

*   Added MDX pipeline support for enhanced docs rendering

*   Updated steel-browser readme with direct links to API docs and OpenAPI specs

*   Enhanced metadata handling across all session types for improved data consistency

*   Updated CDN links for core Steel components to improve loading efficiency


### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed intermediate fingerprinting issues by adding solver and filtering security components

*   Corrected environment variable usage in Steel API configuration

*   Corrected metadata definitions to ensure accurate API documentation compliance

*   Replaced deletion method with timestamp-based deletion across all session types
