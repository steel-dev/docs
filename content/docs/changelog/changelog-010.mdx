Hey! This week we focused on implementing some fixes and improvements to help round out Steel’s DevEx while we prepare for \[REDACTED\]. Let’s get into it!

### 🔧 Bugfixes/Improvements

1.  _Steel Browser_

    *   Improved Chrome args structure and manipulation using ENV variables

    *   Updated Steel browser plugin so you can hook onto custom CDP lifecycle events without editing source code directly

    *   Separated Browser and API launch, resulting in faster API boot times

    *   Standardized package names in the repo for a cleaner dependency structure

2.  _Steel Cloud_

    *   Fixes to re-render bugs that were causing some state update delays

    *   Fixes requests ordering from FE to preload data for a snappier UI

    *   New Signup / Sign-in page dropped :)

    *   Improved browser logs component to make them easier to understand


Thanks for reading & testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to cook for ya’ll.
