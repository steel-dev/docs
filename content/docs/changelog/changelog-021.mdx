Hey everyone! This week we focused on streamlining deployments and fixing a bunch of extension API issues that were causing headaches. Plus some solid infrastructure improvements across the board.

#### Unified UI/API in Steel Browser

Steel-browser now combines the UI and API deployment into a single application setup with a centralized Dockerfile. This makes it much easier to deploy and run Steel across different cloud environments without managing separate services.

*   Resolved extension client testing framework issues for better error reporting


### 🔧 Improvements

*   Centralized error handling and standardized linting rules across the Steel API

*   Updated dependency versions for improved stability across steel-browser

*   Enhanced retry logic in network request handling for better reliability

*   Improved element locators for more accurate browser interactions

*   Streamlined build process by removing lockfile check logic

*   Added environment variable for configuring userDataDir path

*   Enabled organization editing functionality in Steel Cloud dashboard
