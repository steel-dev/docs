Sup chat. Huss here back with your roundup of Steel's first [Launch Week](https://steel.dev/launch-week). We launched new features every day last week (fully recapped below) as well as a new pricing plan.

Let's take a look! 🤸

### Day 1 - Credentials Beta

¯<Image src="/images/cmbf8zotk0gk8120j8adtmpfu.png" alt="Credentials Beta" width={800} height={500} />

Your agents can now automatically sign into password-protected websites without ever seeing your credentials. Built with enterprise-grade AES-256-GCM encryption, TOTP/2FA support, and field blurring protection.

Just store credentials via API, create sessions with credential injection enabled, and Steel will automatically authenticate to unblock your agents. Read the announcement thread here.

### Day 2 - Steel Playground

**Steel Playground** is the first zero-setup tool from Steel that lets you test browser automations faster than ever, directly on the web.

Write Puppeteer, Playwright, or browser-use code and watch it execute live through an integrated session viewer, terminal, and log view. Works with both Python and TypeScript, with 1-click templates from our cookbook! Read the announcement thread here.

### Day 3 - Multi-Region Browser Deployments

At Steel, we understand that latency kills agent performance, especially with hundreds of requests across continents adding up to sluggish experiences.

We've expanded Steel Cloud to 7 global regions with automatic closest-region selection—from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, your browsers spin up wherever makes the most sense. Read the announcement thread here.

### Day 4 - Filesystem V2

<Image src="/images/cmbf90lm40gslym0i1arf4ivq.png" alt="Filesystem V2" width={800} height={500} />

Your agents can now upload, manage, and download files seamlessly within browser sessions, plus get persistent global storage & backups across all automations.

Upload files once and mount them to sessions anywhere, download files from online, or bulk download all artifacts from a session as zip archives. Read the announcement thread here.

### Day 5 - Starter Plan + PAYG

<Image src="/images/cmbf90t3z0h4k4g0hiqrhnqb2.png" alt="Starter Plan + PAYG" width={800} height={500} />

We're (finally) making Steel accessible to every team that wants to test and validate browser automation. There's now a perfect middle ground between tinkering and launching.

**The Starter Plan** gives you $29/month with $29 in credits, plus pay-as-you-go overages so you don't hit limits in prod.
