Chrome extension support, enhanced scraping capabilities, and improved reliability across the platform with 25+ bug fixes.

### ⭐ New

#### Chrome Extension Support

Steel now supports the ability to customize your browser sessions with Chrome Extensions. You can upload and use extensions from files or directly from the Chrome Web Store. Extensions are stored globally per organization and can be injected into any session using extension IDs or the `all_ext` parameter.

```typescript Typescript -wcn -f main.ts
# Upload extension from Chrome Web Store
response = client.extensions.upload_from_store(
    url="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/..."
)

# Inject extensions into session
session = client.sessions.create(
    extension_ids=['all_ext']  # or specific extension IDs
)
```


Extensions integrate with Steel's browser sessions through the Chrome DevTools Protocol and are initialized when sessions start.

**_Available on:_** Steel Cloud ☁️ | Steel-browser (OSS) 🔧

#### Enhanced HTML to Markdown Conversion

Improved scraping algorithms on the `/scrape` endpoint now include HTML sanitization before markdown conversion and other reliability improvements, ensuring cleaner output and preventing rendering issues across all session types.
