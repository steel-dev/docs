Hey y’all! This week's update brings an exciting new Files API for Sessions, along with several improvements to the Steel browser experience and important bugfixes to enhance stability.

### ⭐ New

#### Files API for Sessions 📂

The new Files API enables seamless file management within active browser sessions. You can now upload files from your local machine, use them in your automation workflows, and download files back when needed - perfect for testing file uploads or working with documents in your browser automation.

```typescript Typescript -wcn -f main.ts
// Upload a file to your session
const file = new File(["Hello World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const uploadedFile = await client.sessions.files.upload(session.id, { file });

// Create a CDP session to pass in some custom controls
const cdpSession = await currentContext.newCDPSession(page);
const document = await cdpSession.send("DOM.getDocument");

// We need to find the input element using the selector
const inputNode = await cdpSession.send("DOM.querySelector", {
  nodeId: document.root.nodeId,
  selector: "#load-file",
});

// Set the CSV file as input on the page.
await cdpSession.send("DOM.setFileInputFiles", {
  files: [uploadedFile.path],
  nodeId: inputNode.nodeId,
});

// Download a file from your session
const response = await client.sessions.files.download(session.id, file.id);
const downloadedFile = await response.blob();
```
