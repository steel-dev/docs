Short but sweet update this week while new improvements are cooking! We focused on enhancing proxy handling, browser customization, and squashing some key bugs in the steel-browser repo.

### 🔧 Improvements

*   Implemented dynamic proxy factory for more reliable proxy creation and removed proxy reuse for browser actions in Steel-browser
*   Added support for user-defined browser preferences in Steel API (OS & Cloud), allowing customization of browser behavior across all session types
*   Patched an antibot leak by implementing async timezone fetching with parallelized context extraction and extension path validation in steel-browser
*   Patched OpenAI CUA examples in steel-cookbook

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

*   Fixed session recording issue in Steel Cloud that caused incomplete recordings for sessions using proxies

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.
