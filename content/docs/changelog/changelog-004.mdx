Wooooooooooooo!! We got some new updates we’re pumped to share.

### ⭐ New

#### npx create-steel-app

The easiest way to get started with Steel just dropped!

Run `npx create-steel-app` to spin up a full project based on any of the recipes in the Steel cookbook repo.

**_Note:_** This works with pure Python projects too! As long as you have npm installed, you’ll be able quick spin up projects like Browser-use and Playwright-python on Steel!

#### Multitab Support

We shipped support for multiple tabs via the debug URL. This comes with support for embedding specific pages as well as a full browser view that displays all tabs with full interactivity. Essentially a fully embeddable browser UI can now exist right in your app. Light/dark mode supported ;)

#### Embed and view session recordings

We’ve published an endpoint (`v1/sessions/:id/events)` and docs around how you can simply embed and view session recordings inside your app.

Here’s a code snippet of how to create an embeddable session replay component:

```typescript Typescript -wc
import rrwebPlayer from 'rrweb-player';
import 'rrweb-player/dist/style.css'; // important for styling of the player

// Once you've fetched the events
const events = await client.sessions.events(session.id)

// Create player element
const playerElement = document.getElementById('player-container');

// Initialize the player with events
const player = new rrwebPlayer({
  target: playerElement,
  props: {
    events: events,
    width: 800,  // Width of the player
    height: 600, // Height of the player
    autoPlay: true,
    skipInactive: true  // Skip periods of inactivity
  }
});
```

#### CUA x Steel

OpenAI’s Computer-use agent just dropped and it’s awesome! We’ve added a whole bunch of resources across the Steel universe to demo how the CUA agent can control a Steel browser!
