### Overview

Steel's profiles API allows you to create, update, and persist profiles acrsoss sessions. Profiles are used to store information about the browser session like auth, cookies, extensions, credentials, and browser settings.

Then you can keep reusing profiles across sessions for each different use case. Think a LinkedIn profile, a GitHub profile, or a Facebook profile.

This allows your agents to look more human, persist everything across sessions and frees you to focus on the most important part of your workflow.

### Limits
- There is a 300 MB limit on the size of a profile, if the upload fails after a session, the profile will be set to a `FAILED` state and cannot be used
- If a profile is not used after 30 days, it will be automatically deleted

### How Profiles Work

Profiles work by storing a snapshot of the browser's User Data Directory. This includes all the data that is stored in the browser, such as cookies, extensions, credentials, and browser settings.

1. Session gets created with a `persistProfile` flag
2. Initial profile gets created with some information on the session and gets stored in an `UPLOADING` state
3. After the session is released, the userDataDir is persisted and the additional information on the profile is updated and the profile is set to the `READY` state
4. Whenever a session is created with the `profileId`, the profile is loaded from the storage and the session is started with the same userDataDir and context

#### Persist a profile when starting a session

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Start a session and persist the profile
const firstSession = await client.sessions.create({ persistProfile: true })
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Start a session and persist the profile
first_session = client.sessions.create(persist_profile=True)
```
</CodeTabs>

#### Start a second session with your new profile

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Start a session with the persisted profile
const secondSession = await client.sessions.create({ profileId: firstSession.profileId })
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Start a session with the persisted profile
second_session = client.sessions.create(profile_id=first_session.profile_id)
```
</CodeTabs>

This will return a profileId from the session which will allow you to pass it into new sessions in the future.

### Persisting browser information automatically

Persisting additional information about the browser session like auth, cookies, extensions, credentials, and browser settings is not on by default, to keep building up context with each session, pass persistProfile=True along with your profileId.

#### Update your profile after a new session

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Update the profile with new information, this will update the profile with whatever happens in the session
const thirdSession = await client.sessions.create({ profileId: firstSession.profileId, persistProfile: true })
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Update the profile with new information, this will update the profile with whatever happens in the session
third_session = client.sessions.create(profile_id=first_session.profile_id, persist_profile=True)
```
</CodeTabs>

### Persisting browser information manually

You can also manually create and update a profile via the Profiles API. This allows you to update the proxy, user-agent, or replace the entire userDataDir for your profile.

#### Create your profile

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Create a new profile with new information
await client.profiles.create({ userDataDir: fs.readFileSync('path/to/userDataDir.zip'), userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'})
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Create a new profile with new information
with open("path/to/userDataDir.zip", "rb") as file:
    client.profiles.create(user_data_dir=file, user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3')
```
</CodeTabs>


#### Update your profile with some information

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Update the profile with new information, this will be used next session
await client.profiles.update(firstSession.profileId, { userAgent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'})
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Update the profile with new information, this will be used next session
client.profiles.update(first_session.profile_id, user_agent='Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3')
```
