## Overview
Steel offers two powerful ways to use proxies: our built-in **Managed Residential Proxies** or connecting to your own proxy provider with our **Bring Your Own Proxy (BYOP)** feature.

### Which Proxy Approach Should you choose?

### Steel-Managed Proxies

⭐ **_This is the best option for most use-cases._**

Steel maintains a high-quality pool of residential IP addresses that make your browser sessions appear to come from real user connections. Our residential proxy network includes:

*   **Hundreds of millions of IP addresses** sourced from legitimate residential connections

*   **United States locations by default** with options for global geographic targeting

*   **Continuous quality monitoring** through our internal testing and validation systems

*   **Automatic IP rotation** to ensure fresh addresses for each session


These proxies are ideal for accessing sites that block datacenter IPs or when you need to appear as a genuine residential user.

### Default Behavior (No Proxies)

When you create a Steel session without enabling proxies, your requests originate from the datacenter/machine’s IP addresses where Steel's browser infrastructure is hosted. This option is free, available on all plans, and incurs no charges on proxy bandwidth. This approach works well for:

*   Interacting with websites that aren’t blocking default these datacenter IPs

*   General web scraping that doesn't require specific geographic locations

*   Internal applications or APIs that don't have geo-restrictions

*   Testing and development where IP location isn't critical


### Bring Your Own Proxies (BYOP)

If you have existing proxy infrastructure or specific proxy requirements, you can route Steel sessions through your own proxy servers. This approach gives you:

*   **Complete control** over your proxy infrastructure and IP sources

*   **No additional costs** from Steel - you only pay for your own proxy services

*   **Flexibility** to use specialized proxy providers or custom configurations

*   **Compatibility** with both Steel Cloud and the open-source Steel browser


By default, proxies are disabled (`useProxy: false` is the implicit setting). This means your traffic originates from Steel's own datacenter IPs.

### Using Steel-Managed Residential Proxies

To enable it, simply set `useProxy: true` when creating a session. By default, your traffic will be routed through a new US-based IP address each session:


<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Typescript SDK
const session = await client.sessions.create({
    useProxy: true
});
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Python SDK
session = client.sessions.create(
    use_proxy=True
)
```
</CodeTabs>

### Geographic Targeting

You can easily target countries, states (US only), or cities:

**Quality vs. Specificity**

The more specific your targeting, the smaller the IP pool. For the best performance and highest quality IPs, use the broadest targeting that meets your needs (e.g., prefer country-level over city-level). Generally, we’ve seen US and GB proxies have the highest quality.

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Target specific state
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  useProxy: {
    geolocation: { country: "US", state: "NY" },
  },
});

// Target specific city
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  useProxy: {
    geolocation: { city: "LOS_ANGELES" },
  },
});
```


```python !! Python -wcn
# Target specific state
session = client.sessions.create(
    use_proxy={
        "geolocation": { "country": "US", "state": "NY" }
    }
)

# Target specific city
session = client.sessions.create(
    use_proxy={
        "geolocation": { "city": "LOS_ANGELES" }
    }
)
```

</CodeTabs>

**Available targeting options:**

*   **Countries**: We support over 200 countries via their two-letter Alpha-2 codes

*   **States**: Supported for the US only

*   **Cities**: Available for major global cities


### Bring Your Own Proxies (BYOP)

If you already have a proxy provider or need highly specialized configurations, you can route Steel sessions through your own proxy server. This gives you complete control and avoids any additional proxy fees from Steel.

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
// Typescript SDK
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  useProxy: {
    server: "http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080",
  },
});
```

```python !! Python -wcn
# Python SDK
session = client.sessions.create(
    use_proxy={
        "server": "http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080"
    }
)
```
</CodeTabs>

**Supported proxy formats:**

*   `http://username:password@hostname:port`

*   `https://username:password@hostname:port`

*   `socks5://username:password@hostname:port`


Your proxy credentials are handled securely and never logged or stored by Steel beyond the duration of your session.

#### Proxy Connection Errors

You may occasionally encounter proxy connection errors like `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED`, `ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED`, or `ERR_CONN_REFUSED`. This error indicates a connectivity issue between Steel's infrastructure and the proxy server.

**This is normal behavior** and can happen for several reasons:

*   Temporary proxy server unavailability

*   Network connectivity issues between Steel and the proxy

*   The target website blocking the specific proxy IP


**When this happens:**

1.  **Retry your request.** These errors are usually transient.

2.  If using **Steel-Managed proxies,** we automatically rotate to a new IP on retry.

3.  If using **BYOP**, ensure your proxy server is online and accessible.


If the error persists across multiple retries, it may point to a more systemic issue.

#### **Website Blocking**

To maintain a high-quality and compliant network, Steel and its partners may restrict access to certain websites. We do this to ensure the long-term health and reputation of our IP pool. Blocklists are typically maintained for:

*   Gambling and betting websites

*   Government and restricted institutional sites

*   Ticketing websites

*   Other categories flagged for compliance reasons


**If you're experiencing unexpected or persistent blocking:**

1.  **Change the geographic region.** A different IP block might solve the problem.

2.  **Use BYOP.** If you need access to specific restricted content, using your own proxy provider gives you full control.

3.  **Contact Support.** If you believe a legitimate site is being blocked, please let us know. If retries and changing regions consistently fail, it might indicate the domain is on a compliance blocklist. Escalating to our team helps us investigate.


Most blocking issues can be resolved through configuration adjustments or by working with our team to whitelist specific domains.

Follow these guidelines to get the most out of your proxies and build more resilient automations.

1.  **Establish a Baseline Without Proxies**
    Before assuming you need a proxy for anti-bot measures, try accessing the target website without one. If Steel's default datacenter IPs work, you can save on costs. Use proxies as the next step if you encounter blocks.

2.  **Start with Broad Targeting**
    For the best performance, always start with country-level targeting. The larger IP pool provides higher quality and better success rates. Only use state or city-level targeting when it is a strict requirement for your use case.

3.  **Build Fallback Logic in Your Code**
    Proxy connections can sometimes fail (e.g., `ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED`). This is normal. Your code should anticipate this by including retry logic. For critical tasks, consider having a fallback plan, such as retrying the request without a proxy or with a different proxy configuration.

4.  **Monitor Success Rates with Narrow Targeting**
    If you must use city-level targeting, closely monitor your job success rates. A high rate of failure could mean the local IP pool is too small or contains IPs that have been blocked or are of lower quality.

5.  **Test Different Regions for Blocked Content**
    If you're consistently blocked when targeting a specific country, try your request again from a different region. The target website may have different rules or restrictions for different geographic locations.
