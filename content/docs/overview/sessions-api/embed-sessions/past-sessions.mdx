Steel automatically records every session so you can replay it later.  
With the new headful session recordings, you can now embed real MP4 playback — no event reconstruction, no missing UI elements.

For older implementations, we still support headless playback via rrweb.

## Embed Headful Session Recordings (Recommended)

### What Changed
Steel has moved from slow, unreliable screencasting and event-based playback to full OS-level streaming and MP4 recordings.

- 25fps WebRTC-based video streaming  
- MP4 recordings showing the exact screen output  
- No discrepancies between actual sessions and replays  

> **Tip:** Headful sessions are now **default** for all Steel sessions.  
> No changes are needed to your integration — this gives you direct control over embedding playback.

### Retrieving the Recording Playlist

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```typescript !! Typescript -wcn
const playlist = await fetch("https://api.steel.dev/v1/sessions/{session_id}/hls", {
  headers: {
    "steel-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
  }
});
```

```python !! Python -wcn
import requests

url = "https://api.steel.dev/v1/sessions/{session_id}/hls"
headers = {
    "steel-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
playlist = response.text
```

</CodeTabs>

This returns an HLS playlist that can be used in any compatible video player.

### Embedding in a Web Page

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <video id="player" controls playsinline style="width:100%;max-width:900px;"></video>

    <script type="module">
      import Hls from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/hls.js@^1.5.0/dist/hls.mjs";
      const sessionId = "e4d682bb-a7f2-432c-ad13-8b116695d59e";
      const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY";
      const manifestUrl = `https://api.steel.dev/v1/sessions/${sessionId}/hls`;
      const video = document.getElementById("player");

      if (Hls.isSupported()) {
        const hls = new Hls({
          xhrSetup: (xhr) => {
            xhr.setRequestHeader("steel-api-key", API_KEY);
          }
        });
        hls.loadSource(manifestUrl);
        hls.attachMedia(video);
      } else if (video.canPlayType("application/vnd.apple.mpegurl")) {
        video.src = manifestUrl;
      } else {
        video.outerHTML = "<p>Your browser does not support HLS.</p>";
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Notes:**
- Works with any HLS-compatible player (e.g., Safari, HLS.js, JW Player, Video.js).  
- Recordings are durable MP4 streams for accurate, 1:1 playback.

## Headless

> Headless playback is supported for legacy sessions.  
> New sessions use headful replays for full visual fidelity — we recommend migrating when possible.

### Overview
Every Steel browser session records page events.  
You can fetch those events from the `/v1/sessions/:id/events` endpoint and replay them using `rrweb-player`.

### Retrieve the Recorded Events

**SDK Example**

```ts
const events = await client.sessions.events(session.id);
```

or

```python
events = client.sessions.events(session_id=session.id)
```

**Direct API**

```text
GET /v1/sessions/:id/events
```

### Replay with rrweb-player

**Install**
```bash
npm install rrweb-player
```

**Usage**
```ts
import rrwebPlayer from "rrweb-player";
import "rrweb-player/dist/style.css";

const events = await client.sessions.events(session.id);
const playerElement = document.getElementById("player-container");

new rrwebPlayer({
  target: playerElement,
  props: {
    events: events,
    width: 800,
    height: 600,
    autoPlay: true,
    skipInactive: true
  }
});
```

**HTML**
```html
<div id="player-container"></div>
```

---

### Summary
All new sessions now run **headful by default**.  
Headless event-based playback remains available for legacy recordings but will be deprecated in the future.  
Use headful recordings for the most accurate, reliable replays.
