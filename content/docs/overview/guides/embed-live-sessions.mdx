Every Steel browser session comes with a debug URL that provides a flexible way to view and interact with the session. While Steel's dashboard includes a full-featured session viewer for monitoring your sessions, the debug URL feature allows you to implement custom viewing solutions in your applications and let viewers control browser sessions remotely.



### Prerequisites

*   A Steel API key

*   An active Steel browser session

*   Basic familiarity with HTML and JavaScript/Python



### Getting the Debug URL

When creating a session through our API, the response includes a `debugUrl`.

Here's how to retrieve it using Steel’s SDKs:

<CodeTabs storage="languageSwitcher">

```python !! Python -wcn
from steel import Steel

client = Steel()
session = client.sessions.create()

# Get the debug URL
debug_url = session.debug_url
print(f"Debug URL: {debug_url}")
```

```typescript !! TypeScript -wcn
import Steel from 'steel-sdk';

const client = new Steel();
const session = await client.sessions.create();

// Get the debug URL
const debugUrl = session.debugUrl;
console.log(`Debug URL: ${debugUrl}`);
```

</CodeTabs>


Once you have the debug URL, you can open it directly in your browser to quickly view your session.



### Embedding Sessions in Your Application

For production use cases, you can embed the session view in your application using an iframe:
```typescript Typescript -wcn
<iframe
    src={session.debugUrl}
    style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"
></iframe>
```

The view will automatically scale to fit the iframe container while maintaining aspect ratio.

Debug URLs are not authenticated. Anyone with access to a session's debug URL can view that session. Consider this when implementing session sharing features.



### Configuration Options

Customize the embedded view using UTM parameters:
```typescript Typescript -wcn
<iframe
    src={`${session.debugUrl}?theme=light&interactive=true&showControls=true`}
    style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"
></iframe>
```

| Parameter     | Type    | Default   | Description |
|----------------|---------|-----------|--------------|
| `pageId`       | string  | (empty)   | Optional: This will enable a single tab view of a particular pageId. You can fetch pageIds either directly from Playwright/Puppeteer or using the Live Details endpoint. |
| `pageIndex`    | string  | (empty)   | Optional: This will enable a single tab view of tab N where N is the index passed in. So if you want to only display the first page, passing in `pageIndex=0` will do that. |
| `theme`        | string  | `"dark"`  | Visual theme of the interface (`"dark"` or `"light"`). |
| `interactive`  | boolean | `true`    | When enabled, viewers can interact with the page through clicks, scrolling, and navigation. |
| `showControls` | boolean | `true`    | Shows/hides the URL input and navigation controls. |

### Common Use Cases

#### Sharing Session Views

Embed a fullscreen read-only session view:
```typescript Typescript -wnc
<iframe
  src={`${session.debugUrl}?interactive=false&showControls=false`}
  style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: none;"
></iframe>
```

#### Human-in-the-Loop Workflows

The debug URL feature is particularly useful for human-in-the-loop workflows, where you need to enable human intervention in automated processes. See our detailed guide on [implementing human-in-the-loop workflows](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/implementing-human-in-the-loop-controls) for more information.

### Working with Tabs

#### Multi-tab View

By default, the debug url will return a multi-tab view of the browser. When a new page/tab is created, the viewer will auto switch to that new tab. It will not switch back if the focus is set to a previous tab. When `interactive=false` is appended to the debugUrl in the iframe, switching between tabs will be disabled (along with every other interaction), so be wary of that if you need to switch between tabs in a non-interactive view.

#### Single-tab View

When a `pageId` or a `pageIndex` is passed into the debug url, the browser view will only focus on that page and no other tabs will be shown. This is useful when you only want to present one tab to the user and either manually switch tabs (by passing in a different `pageId` or `pageIndex`) or just generally disable other pages.

### Troubleshooting

*   If the iframe appears blank, ensure your session is still active and has actions sent to it like navigating to new pages.

*   If interaction isn't working, verify that `interactive=true` is set

*   For sizing issues, check that your container has explicit dimensions (use the `dimensions` parameter when creating your session)

*   Make sure your session hasn't timed out (default timeout is 5 minutes)
