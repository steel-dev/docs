### How Credits Work

Each plan's cost goes towards your credits within the platform. For example, if you're on the Developer Plan, every time your subscription renews, you will have $99 worth of credits to use within the platform.

Different plans offer different rates for actions within Steel, with each plan progressively getting more efficient (bigger plans = more bang for your buck).

### Pay-as-You-Go Overages

All paid plans (Starter, Developer, Pro) include pay-as-you-go overages to prevent workflow interruptions:

*   **Overage Limit:** Use up to 3x your monthly credit allocation

*   **Billing:** Overages are billed at your plan's rates at the end of each billing cycle

*   **No Interruption:** Continue building without upgrade pressure or hitting hard limits


**Example:** On the Starter Plan ($29), you can use up to $87 worth of services in a month. Your first $29 is covered by your subscription, and any usage from $29-$87 is billed as overages at Starter rates.

### Credit Equivalents by Plan

Here's roughly\* what you'd get if you spent all of your base credits on a given service:

#### Hobby Plan ($10 free credits)

*   100 browser hours


#### Starter Plan ($29 in credits)

*   290 browser hours

*   2.9GB proxy bandwidth

*   7,250 captcha solves


#### Developer Plan ($99 in credits)

*   1,238 browser hours

*   12 GB proxy bandwidth

*   28k captcha solves


#### Pro Plan ($499 in credits)

*   9,980 browser hours

*   166 GB proxy bandwidth

*   166k captcha solves


\* We say roughly because in practice you couldn't spend all your credits on one thing other than browser hours, since you need to be in a session to use proxies or captcha solves.

**_Enterprise plans offer even further cost efficiency with an annual commitment._**
