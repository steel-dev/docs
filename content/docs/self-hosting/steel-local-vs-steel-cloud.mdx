*             Feature          :             Extensions
  *             Steel Local          :             Supported by loading in `api/extensions/`
  *             Steel Cloud          :             Supported by using the Extensions API
*             Feature          :             Files
  *             Steel Local          :             Not supported
  *             Steel Cloud          :             Supported by the Files API


The defining factor between running Steel locally and using Steel Cloud is concurrency.

For the Extensions API, if you put the extensions you would like to build/load in the \``` api/src/extensions/` `` folder then Steel Local will build these and inject them into the session. Credentials are not supported in Steel Local.
