# Overview | Overview
Claude Computer Use employs vision-based AI to control browsers by continuously analyzing visual feedback, making decisions, and taking actions in a dynamic loop until the task is completed or a certain threshold is reached.

#### Overview

The Claude Computer Use integration connects Claude 3.5 Sonnet (and newer models) with Steel's browser infrastructure. This integration enables AI agents to:

*   Control Steel browser sessions via Claude's Computer Use API

*   Execute browser actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling

*   Automate complex web tasks and multi-step workflows

*   Process visual feedback from screenshots

*   Implement human verification for sensitive operations


Combining Claude's Computer Use with Steel gives you reliable automation with anti-bot capabilities, proxy support, and sandboxed environments.

#### Requirements & Limitations

*   **Anthropic API Key**: Access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet or newer models

*   **Steel API Key**: Active subscription to Steel

*   **Python or Node.js Environment**: Support for API clients for both services

*   **Supported Environments**: Works best with Steel's browser environment

*   **Beta Status**: Computer Use is currently in beta with some limitations
