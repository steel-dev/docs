### Overview

Val Town enables you to run Steel + Puppeteer scripts as serverless functions with one-click deployment. Write your automation code in the browser, schedule it to run on intervals, or trigger it via API endpoints - all without managing servers or containers.

Val Town runs on the Deno runtime and supports JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and TSX. For Puppeteer integrations, we recommend using the deno-puppeteer library as shown in the below starter template.
