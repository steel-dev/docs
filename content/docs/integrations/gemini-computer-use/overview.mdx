### Overview

The Gemini Computer Use integration allows you to connect Gemini 2.5's vision and reasoning capabilities with Steel's reliable browser infrastructure. This integration enables AI agents to:

*   Control Steel browser sessions via the Gemini API

*   Execute real browser actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling

*   Perform complex web tasks such as form filling, searching, and navigation

*   Process visual feedback from screenshots to determine next actions

*   Handle normalized coordinate systems automatically


By combining Gemini's Computer Use with Steel's cloud browser infrastructure, you can build robust, scalable web automation solutions that leverage Steel's anti-bot capabilities, proxy management, and sandboxed environments.

### Requirements & Limitations

*   **Gemini API Key**: Access to the Gemini API with the gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview model

*   **Steel API Key**: Active subscription to Steel

*   **Python/Node Environment**: Support for API clients for both services

*   **Supported Environments**: Works best with Steel's browser environment
