### Overview

Run Steel browser automation scripts with JavaScript/TypeScript directly in StackBlitz without any local setup or installation. This browser-based environment makes it perfect for quick prototyping, sharing running examples, or collaborative development.

Plus, with [Bolt.new](http://bolt.new/) (StackBlitz's AI-powered web development agent), you can use natural language to write scripts and build full-stack applications around Steel's capabilities—all instantly in your browser.

While StackBlitz has limited Python support, we currently only offer TypeScript templates for Steel.

### Requirements & Limitations

*   Steel API key (any plan, get a free key [here](https://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys))

*   Supported languages: JavaScript and TypeScript

*   No account required to run code (only to save changes)


### Starter Templates

*   [**Steel Puppeteer Starter**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/steel-puppeteer-starter) - Node.js template using Puppeteer

*   [**Steel Playwright Starter**](https://stackblitz.com/edit/steel-playwright-starter) - Node.js template using Playwright


### Running any template

To run any of the starter templates:

1.  Click on the template link above to open it in StackBlitz

2.  Set your `STEEL_API_KEY` in one of two ways:

    *   Export it in the terminal: `export STEEL_API_KEY=your_key_here`

    *   Create a `.env` file and add: `STEEL_API_KEY=your_key_here`


    Note: Don't have an API key? Get a free key at [app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys](http://app.steel.dev/settings/api-keys)

3.  Run the command `npm run` in the terminal to run the script


No account is required to run or even edit the templates - you only need to sign in if you want to save your changes.
