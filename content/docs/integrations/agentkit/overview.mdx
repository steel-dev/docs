# Overview | Overview
AgentKit is a TypeScript library for creating and orchestrating AI agents, from single-model calls to multi-agent networks with deterministic routing, shared state, and rich tooling via MCP.

#### Overview

The AgentKit integration connects Steel’s cloud browser sessions with AgentKit’s **Networks**, **Routers**, and **Agents**, so you can:

*   Drive Steel browsers from AgentKit agents and tools (navigate, search, fill forms, extract results)

*   Orchestrate multi-agent **Networks** with shared **State** and code/LLM-based **Routers**

*   Plug in MCP servers as tools for powerful real-world actions (DBs, apps, services)

*   Stream live tokens/steps to your UI and capture traces locally during development

*   Mix deterministic flows with autonomous handoffs for reliable, production-grade automations


Combined, Steel + AgentKit gives you scalable web automation with sandboxed, anti-bot capable browsers and fault-tolerant orchestration.

#### Requirements

*   **Steel API Key**: Active Steel subscription to create/manage browser sessions

*   **Node.js**: v20+ recommended

*   **Package Setup**: `npm i @inngest/agent-kit inngest` (AgentKit ≥ v0.9.0 requires `inngest` alongside)

*   **Model Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints

*   **Optional**: MCP servers (e.g., via Smithery), search tools, vector stores, observability
