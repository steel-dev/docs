# Overview | Overview
Agno is a full-stack framework for building multi-agent systems with shared memory, knowledge, and reasoning.

#### Overview

The Agno integration connects Steel’s cloud browser infrastructure with Agno’s agent and team architecture, so you can:

*   Launch and control Steel browser sessions as Agno tools inside single agents or coordinated agent teams

*   Automate multi-step web workflows (navigate, search, fill forms, extract data) with shared context and memory

*   Combine Agentic RAG and web automation for up-to-date answers using your preferred vector stores

*   Use reasoning (reasoning models or Agno’s ReasoningTools) for more reliable plans and actions

*   Return structured outputs (JSON/typed) and monitor runs end-to-end


Agno is model-agnostic (23+ providers supported) and natively multi-modal, which pairs well with Steel’s reliable, sandboxed browsers, proxy management, and anti-bot capabilities.

#### Requirements

*   **Steel API Key**: Active Steel subscription to create and manage browser sessions

*   **Model Provider Key(s)**: e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, etc. (Agno supports many providers)

*   **Python Environment**: Agno is Python-first (works great with modern Python runtimes)

*   **Optional Storage**: Vector DB + memory/session storage for Agentic RAG and long-term memory
