#### Overview

The CrewAI integration connects Steel’s reliable cloud browsers with CrewAI’s **Crews** (autonomous agent teams) and **Flows** (event-driven orchestration). This lets you:

*   Launch & control Steel browser sessions from CrewAI agents and tasks

*   Automate complex web workflows (search, navigate, form-fill, extract, validate) with agent collaboration

*   Mix autonomy (Crews) with precise control (Flows) for production-grade pipelines

*   Share memory/state across steps and return structured outputs (JSON/typed)

*   Add human-in-the-loop checkpoints for sensitive actions and final reviews


Together, CrewAI + Steel deliver scalable, enterprise-ready web automation with proxies, sandboxed isolation, and anti-bot options.

#### Requirements

*   **Steel API Key**: Active Steel subscription to create/manage browser sessions

*   **LLM API Key(s)**: e.g., OpenAI (or your preferred provider/local runtime)

*   **Python**: 3.10–3.13 recommended

*   **Optional Tools**: Search (e.g., [Serper.dev](http://serper.dev/)), vector stores, and custom tools as needed
