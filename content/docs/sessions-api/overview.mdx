# Overview
Manage fleets of browser sessions with ease

The Sessions API lets you create and control cloud-based browser sessions through simple API calls. Each session is like a fresh incognito window, but running in our cloud and controlled through code.

Go to Quickstart Example

### What is a Session?

Sessions are the atomic unit of our Sessions API. Think of sessions as giving your AI agents their own dedicated browser windows. Just like you might open an incognito window to start a fresh browsing session, the Sessions API lets your agents spin up isolated browser instances on demand. Each session maintains its own state, cookies, and storage - perfect for AI agents that need to navigate the web, interact with sites, and maintain context across multiple steps.
