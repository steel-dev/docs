## Overview

Add in Chrome extensions to your Steel sessions.

:::scalar-callout{type=warning}
Steel’s Extensions system is currently in beta and is subject to improvements, updates, and changes.

If you have feedback, join our Discord or open an issue on GitHub.
:::

Steel's extensions are designed to enhance the functionality of Steel sessions by providing additional features and capabilities. These extensions can be used to automate tasks, enhance security, and improve the overall agent experience. They can be installed through the API for your organization and attached to any session.

Extensions have long been a part of the browser ecosystem, since the release of Internet Explorer version 4 in 1997, users have been able to create their own extensions and make their browser their own. With the advent of agentic browsing and browser agents, extensions have gained a whole new light. Allowing thousands of agents to extend their own browser sessions with custom functionality.

## Getting Started
Before extensions can be used in a browser session, they must first be uploaded either with a .zip/.crx file or downloaded from the Chrome Web Store.

:::scalar-callout{type=info}
All extensions are stored globally against your organization. You only need to upload them once. The supported formats include .zip and .crx.
:::

### Upload Extension From File

The extensions uploaded have a couple of requirements. They need a [preliminary manifest.json](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/manifest) file to define the extension's metadata and functionality. This file should include details such as the extension's name, version, and any permissions required.

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.steel.dev/v1/extensions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -F "file=@extensions/recorder/recorder.zip"
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
await client.extensions.upload({
    file: fs.readFileSync('extensions/recorder/recorder.zip')
  });
```

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
with open("extensions/recorder/recorder.zip", "rb") as file:
    client.extensions.upload(
        file=file
    )
```
:::

### Upload Extension from Chrome Web Store

Go to the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore) and click on the extension you want to upload. In the URL of the extension's page, you will see a layout like this https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/{extensionName}/{extensionId}. Copy the extension ID and replace the placeholder with the actual ID.

::::scalar-tabs{}

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.steel.dev/v1/extensions/store \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  --data '{"store":"chrome-web-store","extensionId":"extensionId","version":"latest"}'
  # uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
await client.extensions.uploadStore({
    store: "chrome-web-store",
    extensionId: "extensionId", // uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
    version: "latest"
  });
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
client.extensions.upload_store(
    store="chrome-web-store",
    extension_id="extensionId", # uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
    version="latest"
)
```
::::

Once they are installed for your organization, you can inject them into your sessions.

### Inject Extensions into Session

You can inject specific extensions into your sessions based on the `extensionId` field or you can pass `all_ext` to inject all extensions from your organization.

::::scalar-tabs{}

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.steel.dev/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "extensionIds": ['all_ext']
  }'
  # -d '{
  #  "extensionIds": ['extensionId_1', 'extensionId_2']
  # }'
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
const session = await client.sessions.create({
  extensionIds: ['all_ext'] // extensionIds=['extensionId_1', 'extensionId_2']
});
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
client.sessions.create(
    extension_ids=['all_ext'] # extension_ids=['extensionId_1', 'extensionId_2']
)
```
:::

::::

And now your sessions have extensions!

These extensions will be injected into the Steel browser session that then runs with that session. Extensions are loaded and initialized when the session starts. They can communicate with the session using the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) and interact with the browser environment.

### Updating Extensions From File

After using your extensions, you can update them by uploading a new version of the extension. You will need to specify the `extensionId` of the extension you want to update.

::::scalar-tabs{}

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.steel.dev/v1/extensions/{extensionId} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -F "file=@extensions/recorder/recorder.zip"
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
await client.extensions.update("extensionId",{
    file: fs.readFileSync("extensions/recorder/recorder.zip")
  });
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
with open("extensions/recorder/recorder.zip", "rb") as file:
    client.extensions.update("extensionId",
        file=file
    )
```
::::

### Updating Extensions From Chrome Web Store

You will need to specify the `extensionId` of the extension you want to update which will be found in the Chrome Web Store URL, like this https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/{extensionName}/{extensionId}

::::scalar-tabs{}

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X PUT https://api.steel.dev/v1/extensions/store \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  --data '{"store":"chrome-web-store","extensionId":"extensionId","version":"latest"}'
  # uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
await client.extensions.updateStore({
    store: "chrome-web-store",
    extensionId: "extensionId", // uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
    version: "latest"
  });
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
client.extensions.update_store(
    store="chrome-web-store",
    extension_id="extensionId", # uBlock Origin ID: epcnnfbjfcgphgdmggkamkmgojdagdnn
    version="latest"
)
```

### Seeing your Extensions

To see your organization's installed extensions, you can use the `GET /v1/extensions` endpoint.

::::scalar-tabs{}

:::scalar-tab{title="REST"}
```bash
curl -X GET https://api.steel.dev/v1/extensions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "steel-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Node.js"}
```typescript
await client.extensions.list();
```
:::

:::scalar-tab{title="Python"}
```python
client.extensions.list()
```
