## Changelog #011 | 2025-06-03
Sup chat. Huss here back with your roundup of Steel's first [Launch Week](https://steel.dev/launch-week). We launched new features every day last week (fully recapped below) as well as a new pricing plan.

Let's take a look! ü§∏

### Day 1 - Credentials Beta

::scalar-image{src=https://d3b9kr64nievew.cloudfront.net/cmbf5zpf100ey140ilj2haqc9/cmbf8zotk0gk8120j8adtmpfu.png width="560"}

Your agents can now automatically sign into password-protected websites without ever seeing your credentials. Built with enterprise-grade AES-256-GCM encryption, TOTP/2FA support, and field blurring protection.

Just store credentials via API, create sessions with credential injection enabled, and Steel will automatically authenticate to unblock your agents. [Read the announcement thread here.]()

::scalar-button[]{title="Read Credentials API Docs ‚Üí" href=/overview/credentials-api/overview }

### Day 2 - Steel Playground

::scalar-image{src=https://d3b9kr64nievew.cloudfront.net/cmbf5zpf100ey140ilj2haqc9/cmbf8zv4x0g1d2b0j2nrm1cwu.png width="560"}

**Steel Playground** is the first zero-setup tool from Steel that lets you test browser automations faster than ever, directly on the web.

Write Puppeteer, Playwright, or browser-use code and watch it execute live through an integrated session viewer, terminal, and log view. Works with both Python and TypeScript, with 1-click templates from our cookbook! [Read the announcement thread here]().

::scalar-button[]{title="Go to Playground ‚Üí" href=https://playground.steel.dev/ }

## Changelog #008 | 2025-05-06

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/oWlREKD5nejyDprfYbiGM.png}

Howdy y‚Äôall! These last few weeks brought significant improvements to session state management and browser control capabilities, along with several important bugfixes to enhance the Steel experience.

### ‚≠ê New
#### Enhanced Session Context Support üîÑ
Session contexts have been extended to cover indexedDB and sessionStorage, providing more robust state persistence and authentication handling. This improvement allows for more reliable user sessions, especially for sites that rely heavily on client-side storage for auth tokens and application state.

```typescript

// Example: Working with the enhanced session context
const session = await client.sessions.create();
let browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
  `wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=${process.env.STEEL_API_KEY}&sessionId=${session.id}`
);
const page = await browser.contexts()[0].pages()[0];

// Session now maintains indexedDB and sessionStorage state
// Perfect for sites using modern auth patterns
await page.goto('https://app.example.com/login');
await page.fill('#email', 'user@example.com');
await page.fill('#password', 'password123');
await page.click('#login-button');

const sessionContext = await client.sessions.context(session.id);


const session = await client.sessions.create({ sessionContext });
browser = await chromium.connectOverCDP(
    `wss://connect.steel.dev?apiKey=${process.env.STEEL_API_KEY}&sessionId=${session.id}`
);

const page = await browser.contexts()[0].pages()[0];

// State persists across navigation
await page.goto('https://app.example.com/dashboard');
// User remains logged in!
```

**Steel Browser Now Uses Chromium By Default üåê**

We've upgraded Steel Browser to use Chromium as our default browser, replacing our previous Chrome implementation. While Chrome served us well for bypassing basic anti-bot measures and stealth detection, it presented compatibility challenges for M-chip Mac users.

The key issue was that Mac users running Steel Browser through Docker couldn't operate properly, as Chrome lacked distribution support for ARM Linux machines (which our Docker image utilized for Mac compatibility).

Now that we use Chromium by default (which DOES have an ARM Linux compatible distribution);all the issues that Mac users were facing should now be gone.

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Steel Browser is now plugin-based, allowing

- Fixed multiple UI bugs for a smoother user experience

- Resolved an issue with browser updates happening in the background causing interruptions

- Added support for custom Chrome arguments via environment variables

- Improved session stability when working with sites that use indexedDB heavily

- Fixed state synchronization issues between browser restarts

- Repaired the live viewer for Railway deployments in Steel Browser

- You can now call browser actions with existing sessions

- Improved URL and environment variable management in the open-source repository

- Custom domain support throughout steel browser

- +10 other small bugfixes all around

### üíñ First-time contributors
Special thanks to [@aspectrr](https://github.com/aspectrr) for their help on enabling custom Chrome args for Steel Browser; as well as the ability to run browser actions on current pages within a session.

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.

## Changelog #007 | 2025-04-09

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/fYgqRSCjhbqLejUq4fjy8.jpeg}

Hey y‚Äôall! This week's update brings an exciting new Files API for Sessions, along with several improvements to the Steel browser experience and important bugfixes to enhance stability.

### ‚≠ê New
#### Files API for Sessions üìÇ
The new Files API enables seamless file management within active browser sessions. You can now upload files from your local machine, use them in your automation workflows, and download files back when needed - perfect for testing file uploads or working with documents in your browser automation.

```typescript
// Upload a file to your session
const file = new File(["Hello World!"], "hello.txt", { type: "text/plain" });
const uploadedFile = await client.sessions.files.upload(session.id, { file });

// Create a CDP session to pass in some custom controls
const cdpSession = await currentContext.newCDPSession(page);
const document = await cdpSession.send("DOM.getDocument");

// We need to find the input element using the selector
const inputNode = await cdpSession.send("DOM.querySelector", {
  nodeId: document.root.nodeId,
  selector: "#load-file",
});

// Set the CSV file as input on the page.
await cdpSession.send("DOM.setFileInputFiles", {
  files: [uploadedFile.path],
  nodeId: inputNode.nodeId,
});

// Download a file from your session
const response = await client.sessions.files.download(session.id, file.id);
const downloadedFile = await response.blob();
```

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Improved rendering of the session viewer for a slight speed bump in UI updates

- Enhanced logging system for better coverage and debugging capabilities

- Upgraded the session viewer UI on steel-browser for improved usability

- Fixed proxy usage metrics that were incorrectly over-reporting usage

- Improved the UI docker image to accept dynamic API URLs, enabling more flexible custom deployments

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/AKYFQrDhCB_2-dd2MY_si.png}

Happy Wednesday, chat ü´° We've been working hard on some key improvements to our bot detection avoidance capabilities, adding new features, and squashing bugs. Here's what's new this week:

### ‚≠ê New
#### Enhanced Stealth Improvements ü•∑
We've made significant improvements to our stealth features and patched several fingerprinting leaks that were causing browser sessions to be flagged as bots. These updates help ensure your sessions can navigate the web more reliably without triggering anti-bot measures.

**Availability: Steel Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è + Steel-browser (OSS) üîß**

#### Cloudflare Turnstile Solving ‚úÖ
We've launched an early version of Cloudflare Turnstile solving, now included in our CAPTCHA solving module within sessions. The solver works well for most common Turnstile implementations, though we're still refining it for some edge cases.

**Availability: Steel Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è**

#### Take Control Feature in [Surf.new](http://surf.new/) üéÆ
Inspired by OpenAI's Operator, we've implemented a new "Take Control" feature in [Surf.new](http://surf.new/). This allows you to:

- Pause the AI agent and manually interact with the browser

- Complete complex tasks like signing into websites

- Hand control back to the AI to continue where you left off

This showcase demonstrates the power of our debug URL capabilities, which you can integrate into your own applications.

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Fixed issues with the one-click deployment to Railway on steel-browser

- Better error handling for incorrect inputs

- Frontend updates for multi-tab / playback

- Various performance optimizations for browser initialization

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/aDM_u6zJ-T_yBeJYgkvRh.png}

Wooooooooooooo!! We got some new updates we‚Äôre pumped to share.

‚≠ê New
**npx create-steel-app**
The easiest way to get started with Steel just dropped!

Run `npx create-steel-app` to spin up a full project based on any of the recipes in the Steel cookbook repo.

**_Note:_** This works with pure Python projects too! As long as you have npm installed, you‚Äôll be able quick spin up projects like Browser-use and Playwright-python on Steel!

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/jEdp6vzjOSMWbz2ePv3gO.png}

#### Multitab Support
We shipped support for multiple tabs via the debug URL. This comes with support for embedding specific pages as well as a full browser view that displays all tabs with full interactivity. Essentially a fully embeddable browser UI can now exist right in your app. Light/dark mode supported ;)

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/8LAdzG-x1Li9Nf3Q6VB4P.png}

[Documentation Link](/overview/guides/view-and-embed-live-sessions)

#### Embed and view session recordings
We‚Äôve published an endpoint (`v1/sessions/:id/events`) and docs around how you can simply embed and view session recordings inside your app.

Here‚Äôs a code snippet of how to create an embeddable session replay component:

```typescript
import rrwebPlayer from 'rrweb-player';
import 'rrweb-player/dist/style.css'; // important for styling of the player

// Once you've fetched the events
const events = await client.sessions.events(session.id)

// Create player element
const playerElement = document.getElementById('player-container');

// Initialize the player with events
const player = new rrwebPlayer({
  target: playerElement,
  props: {
    events: events,
    width: 800,  // Width of the player
    height: 600, // Height of the player
    autoPlay: true,
    skipInactive: true  // Skip periods of inactivity
  }
});
```

[Documentation Link](/overview/guides/embed-session-recordings)

#### CUA x Steel
OpenAI‚Äôs Computer-use agent just dropped and it‚Äôs awesome! We‚Äôve added a whole bunch of resources across the Steel universe to demo how the CUA agent can control a Steel browser!

- [Cookbook: Simple CUA Loop (Python)](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook/tree/main/examples/steel-oai-computer-use-python-starter)

- [Cookbook: Simple CUA Loop (Node)](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook/tree/main/examples/steel-oai-computer-use-node-starter)

- Coming soon to [Surf.new](http://surf.new/) üåä

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Python/Node SDKs are out of beta and official starting on version `0.0.1` ü•Ç This update comes with all the afore mentioned capabilities incorporated into the SDKs.

- Lots of improvements and fixes to the Surf UI

- Added guide to docs on how to re-use contexts between sessions for carrying over things like authenticated state ([docs](/overview/guides/reusing-contexts-auth))

- Patches some source of memory leak errors causing slower session times

### üè° Housekeeping
- Carti dropped üó£Ô∏è

### üíñ First-time contributors
Special thanks to [@PaperBoardOfficial](https://github.com/PaperBoardOfficial) for making some key PRs and issues on Surf üíñ

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.

## Changelog #003 | 2025-03-04

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/ByP4qtaUIR447nJaZqbPS.png}

Happy Tuesday everyone! This week, the team has been heads down working through customer issues/bugs/complaints (especially the trickier ones) and we have a lot of exciting stuff in the works. But first, some updates!

### ‚≠ê New
#### Browser Agent Leaderboard üèÜ | [leaderboard.steel.dev](https://leaderboard.steel.dev/)

We‚Äôve been seeing some exciting new developments in the web agent space. From OpenAI Operator, to Browser Use, there‚Äôs been a ton of announcements in the last two months and the state of the art is constantly being outdone. That‚Äôs why we decided to launch a leaderboard, compiling the top ranking web agents based on WebVoyager results.

::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/Bn_vj6cr558fhVAl0PJPX.png}


#### Lightning-fast Session Creation Times ‚ö°Ô∏è

Now, when creating a session that uses that use default value (except timeout, you can change that), sessions will be booted up in ~400ms or less. This was possible due to some new scaling logic that we laid out which allows us to keep new clean browser sessions hot and ready to be used.


::scalar-image{src=https://api.scalar.com/cdn/images/jBw8j7D0nDuWr2AD2vuO5/etXHsy_awCwDv2MZrMHbX.png}

**Note:** these optimizations will not affect sessions using custom proxies or non-default session creation flags.

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Resizing the live session view iframe that‚Äôs returned from session.debugUrl no longer produces a black screen

- Hiding the session details tab no longer breaks the session viewer on [app.steel.dev](http://app.steel.dev/)

- Recorded DOM events are now compressed in transport, allowing for smaller sizes in transport (don‚Äôt forget to unpack when displaying recorded events)

### üíñ First-time contributors
Special thanks to [@junhsss](https://github.com/junhsss) for adding a file management API to Steel Browser. This will allow for very neat applications on both the open source repo and Steel Cloud!

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.

\
## Changelog #002 | 2025-02-25
We decided to maniacally focus on the Steel UX this week and we‚Äôre crazy pumped to show you what‚Äôs new. Let‚Äôs get it ü´°

### ‚≠ê New
#### New Steel Dashboard Experience ‚ú®

The Steel dashboard has a sleek new look and feel! We‚Äôve redesigned what it feels like to use Steel Cloud and get onboarded for the first time. We focused on quickly getting started for new users and starting new projects for experienced users.

We‚Äôre super proud of this one and look forward to your feedback.

::scalar-embed[Quick run through of new Steel Quickstart Experience]{src="https://h33f0d69tq.ufs.sh/f/8f4EspggSXKHg9av2FtnfPyILuxSrCpz2BaJq7DQvTd6cZe0"}

\* Coming to the steel-browser repo experience soon!

#### Docs & cookbook updatesüë®‚Äçüç≥
You asked and we listened: A bunch of new resources have been created across the Steel Universe.

- *Browser-use*: We‚Äôve added a cookbook example and quickstart guide to using browser-use with Steel. Browser-use x Steel is an insanely powerful combo we‚Äôve seen many users deploy and wanted to help make it even easier to get started.

  - [Cookbook Example](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-cookbook/tree/main/examples/steel-browser-use-starter) | [Quickstart Guide](/overview/integrations/browser-use/quickstart)

- *DebugURL use-cases*: We‚Äôve added new guides to our docs with a focus on how to best leverage the powerful little debug URL you get back from a Steel session response. Check em out:

  - [Embed and view live sessions](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/view-and-embed-live-sessions) | [Human in the Loop Controls](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/implement-human-in-the-loop-controls)

#### Surf model updates

We‚Äôve upgraded [surf.new](http://surf.new/) with a bunch of new models that you can try out like:

- **Deepseek** (`deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner`)

- **Gemini** (like `2.0 flash` _fast!_)

- *Claude 3.7 sonnet* (woah + _fast!_)

Or use local models running on your computer with Ollama support :)

### üîß Bugfixes/Improvements
- Patched issues with fetching and re-using contexts between Sessions (docs coming soon)

- DebugURL went through a variety of changes + has had it‚Äôs full capabilities rolled out to the steel-browser repo

- Added event counts to Steel Cloud‚Äôs Sessions page to make it easier to sift through sessions lists

- Steel-browser: Improved logging across the board + other upgrades (checkout the latest release here: : [v0.1.3-beta](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser/releases/tag/v0.1.3-beta))

- Improved session viewer reliability across the board when viewing live sessions (even more coming!)

### üè° Housekeeping
This week, we welcomed [Mislav](https://x.com/mislavjc) to the Steel team! He‚Äôll be working on making building agents on Steel even easier and more capable. You can bug him in the Steel discord server @mislavjc.

### üíñ First-time contributors
Special thanks [@hakzarov](https://github.com/hakzarov) for adding better logging for both the API and the Chrome process on the steel-browser repo!

As always, thanks for testing out the Steel beta. We really look forward to more of your feedback and continuing to build with this awesome, curious, and supportive community.

\
## Changelog #001 | 2025-02-09
Happy Super Bowl Sunday üèà Before we settle in to lose money on our respective betting apps, we have some updates we NEED to tell you about.

### ‚≠ê New
Introducing [Surf.new](http://surf.new/)

[Surf.new](http://surf.new/) is an open-source playground for chatting with different web-agents via Steel. We want it to serve as a resource for the community to try out new web agents as they become available, helping developers evaluate what works best for their use-cases. Currently, you can try browser-use's web agent and a browser-specific fork of Claude‚Äôs Computer-use agent. We'll be actively maintaining it while using it as a launching pad to showcase new Steel features and improvements in web automation.

It‚Äôs pretty neat if you ask us ü§† Give it a try and let us know what you think! Contributions are more than welcome too :)

::scalar-embed[Finding Flights on Surf]{src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc50c603-1cb8-49b1-8910-251b6beec228"}


#### Embedding and interactive with Live Sessions
Our debugURL has some new life blown into it and, oh boy, are we ever pumped about it. The debugURL you get returned when creating a session is most commonly used for viewing what‚Äôs happening live in the browser. A common use-case is embedding that view into your app, such that people can see what‚Äôs going on in the browser as actions are being taken. It‚Äôs what powers our live session viewer in the Steel dashboard.

In addition to a complete refactoring to improve performance, some of the improvements include:

- Ability to let a viewer interact with the browser sessions directly via clicking, typing, scrolling, etc. This was a big one lots of people have asked for to powering human-in-the-loop features (think ‚Äútake control‚Äù in OpenAI‚Äôs Operator).

- Ability to show/hide mouse on screen

- Show/hide URL bar & to toggle be light mode or dark mode

All of which can be turned on or off via UTM params. Check out [the docs](https://docs.steel.dev/overview/guides/viewing-and-embedding-live-sessions) for more on this here!

Available on Steel Cloud and available soon on the steel-browser repo.

#### Dimensions for sessions
We now support the ability to set screen + viewport dimensions when creating a session (POST/v1/sessions).

```python
from steel import Steel

client = Steel()

session = client.sessions.create(
    dimensions={
        "width":1280,
        "height":800
    }
)
```

This helps save you from having to set page viewport on every page load. Which can cause buggy resizing behaviour with your sessions.

Available on Steel Cloud and the steel-browser repo.

### Ad blocking
You can now block ads from rendering in your sessions. This is useful for saving on proxy bandwidth, simplifying action space for agents (so they don‚Äôt have the option of clicking on ads), and generally speeding up page load times.

It‚Äôs defaulted to true when starting a session but you can explicitly turn it on/off by passing a bool into the blockAds param in the create session endpoint (POST/v1/sessions) or via the SDK like so:

```python
from steel import Steel

client = Steel()

session = client.sessions.create(
    block_ads=true
)
```

### üîß Fixes/Improvements
Lots of bug fixes and improvements across the board including:

- Fixed with inability to view sessions where proxy was enabled

- Better scrape errors

- Improved Proxy usage tracking

- Fixed multiple issues with Recording sessions

- Implemented graceful shutdowns

- Various dockerfile optimizations

- Custom executable paths for local browsers when running steel-browser repo locally
