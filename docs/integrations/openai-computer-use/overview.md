# Overview
OpenAI's Computer Use is an agent that combines vision capabilities with advanced reasoning to control computer interfaces and perform tasks on behalf of users through a continuous action loop.

### Overview
The OpenAI Computer Use integration allows you to connect GPT-4o's vision and reasoning capabilities with Steel's reliable browser infrastructure. This integration enables AI agents to:

- Control Steel browser sessions via the OpenAI Responses API

- Execute real browser actions like clicking, typing, and scrolling

- Perform complex web tasks such as form filling, searching, and navigation

- Process visual feedback from screenshots to determine next actions

- Implement human-in-the-loop verification for sensitive operations

By combining OpenAI's Computer Use with Steel's cloud browser infrastructure, you can build robust, scalable web automation solutions that leverage Steel's anti-bot capabilities, proxy management, and sandboxed environments.

### Requirements & Limitations
- **OpenAI API Key**: Access to the OpenAI API with the computer-use-preview model

- **Steel API Key**: Active subscription to Steel

- **Python Environment**: Support for Python API clients for both services

- **Supported Environments**: Works best with Steel's browser environment (vs. desktop environments)
